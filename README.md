# Crowdsourcing-Short-Squeeze-Dashboard
The goal of this mini-project is to assist a hypothetical hedge fund in making short selling decisions, by webscraping historical stock/revenue data for two stocks (e.g. Tesla and GameStop) available on the internet, and building a dashboard to compare the price of the stock vs. the profit for the hedge fund.
