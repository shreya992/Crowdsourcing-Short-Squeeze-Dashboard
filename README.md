# Crowdsourcing-Short-Squeeze-Dashboard
The goal of this mini-project is to assist a hypothetical hedge fund in making short selling decisions, by webscraping historical stock/revenue data for two stocks (e.g. Tesla and GameStop) available on the internet, and building a dashboard to compare the price of the stock vs. the profit for the hedge fund.

**Note:** The dashboard visualizations may not be visible clearly on GitHub. A copy of the project file, with visible dashboard plots can be accessed [(here)](https://eu-gb.dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/analytics/notebooks/v2/caf4b0ca-b6e9-4046-9be4-31742c14d779/view?access_token=5b2c030dd4253faf6ec8d0362147abe5dc0c98fa5d4346fd63c962fb7b6cee49).
